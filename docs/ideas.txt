About me
Hi, I am Bo! nice to meet you.
Recently, I have just found my passion in coding while I was learning to develop mobile apps. 
I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my chop. Currently 
enrolled in a programming course and enjoying every moment of it. 

work
Upon graduating from University, I have worked as an engineer 
and a chef. As an engineer, I have worked with embedded systems, programmed mainly in C and C++.
I do love to cook as well so I have been working as a sushi chef.

study
In the year 2014, I have completed my Bachelors of Electronics and Communications Engineering in RMIT University.
I was awarded with first class honours and was the top student in the cohort.
